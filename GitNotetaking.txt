I've long used pastie as a way to keep web accessible notes that i can share with others, review later, etc.  It was a hack job (pastie isn't meant to support that use case), but it wasn't missing much.

A good tool would look a lot like pastie but:
- optimize pasted text for readability
- have a user account that would let you see all your notes
- be private by default but "anyone with URL" sharability
- be unindexed in google by default
- probably other stuff

I can build that -- and might. Camlistore might be a good tool for it.

BUT it occurs to me that github, textedit, and gist, might be a serviceable solution. Plus it let me dick around with github and learn some things, which is always cool.

So -- this is my first foray. I've got a repository setup, https://github.com/tylerwillis/Notes

I have a folder on my machine called notes which holds all my notes and I have that folder open in a TextMate project.

When I want to add a new note, i create a txt doc in TextMate, open up Terminal, and...

cd
cd dekstop
cd notes
git init tylerwillis/notes.git
git add -A
git commit -m 'commit'
git push origin master

and my notes live in git.
